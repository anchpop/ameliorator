# The Ameliorator

This is a bot I wrote that can ameliorate any short string. For example, given:

> just made the fluffiest pancakes i've ever seen in my life

the bot returns

> I have just prepared a delectable breakfast dish consisting of pancakes which were, in terms of fluffiness, the most commendable I have ever had the pleasure of consuming.

It uses the OpenAI api (the DaVinci model) to do the amelioration. 

It's hooked up to a reddit bot. I was going to make it run automatically on Reddit but I couldn't think of a funny way to do it that wouldn't get annoying.
