There's a youtuber called Vaush who speaks in a very verbose way. He likes to use the words "salient", "ameliorated", and "outpaced". Here are some examples of normal speech, converted to be more verbose. 

Normal: got me coughing on my gatorade
Verbose: Admittedly, your words have caused me to be beset by the involuntary expulsion of air from my lungs, to the point where I have now coughed up some of my Gatorade.

Normal: Jet fuel can't melt steel beams but damn, go off sis.
Verbose: Though it is commonly accepted that kerosene-based jet fuel is insufficient to melt the steel support structures of a building, your passion and delivery are truly inspirational.

Normal: What do you want me to do?
Verbose: Might I inquire as to what your hopes and dreams are for me in this current scenario?

Normal: Sneako everytime he calls someone a bot
Verbose: I giggle to myself each time Sneako employs the word "bot" as an insult.

Normal: Did you see your friend Max again?
Verbose: Have you had a second opportunity to cross paths with your chum Max?

Normal: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly
Verbose: It would appear, based on our current understanding of the aerodynamic principles governing flight, that it should be impossible for a bee to outpace gravity vertically.

Normal: I wanna smoke weed
Verbose:I am admittedly beset by an interest in consuming cannabis for the purposes of relaxation and/or enjoyment.

Normal: Good question. I'll have a think about that and get back with you once I'm done here at the gym
Verbose: That is an excellent query. I shall take some time to ruminate on the matter and provide you with a response once I have completed my sojourn to the gymnasium.

Normal: Trying to solve the disagreement through fancy speech.
Verbose: Endeavoring to ameliorate the ongoing controversy through loquacious diction

Normal: Maybe the best thing to do at this point would be to figure out what I could have done differently.
Verbose: Perhaps it would behoove me to consider what actions I could have taken to alter the current course of events.

Normal: The fact that he talks verbosely makes people feel like he's hard to understand, and it prevents him from teaching people effectively.
Verbose: His superfluous language inculates a sense of dissatisfaction with the clarity of his locution, and thus fails to ameliorate ignorance in the broader populace

Normal: Good meme
Verbose: Hysterical image, my comedic friend. 

Normal: I bet I could bench press more than he can
Verbose: I am willing to wager that I could, with respect to the act of pressing a weight upwards from a lying position on a bench, outpace him athletically.

Normal: I'm sorry that he talks in a way that's hard for some people to understand, but his academic background makes it hard for him to talk normally.
Verbose: As unfortunate for you as it is that his natural speech mannerisms are so confounding and bamboozling, his scholarly nature absolutely prohibits him from lowering himself to the intellectual pedestals of the common rabble.

Normal: Vaush asks Destiny to settle their disagreements
Verbose: The streamer known as Vaush calls on his fellow streamer Destiny to ameliorate the salient disputation between them

Normal: Does this improve the conversation?
Verbose: Please explain to me, how does this elucidate the discourse?

Normal: A cat is on me
Verbose: There is a feline on top of me, likely because it enjoys the warmth of my body.

Normal: I had a great lunch today of eggs and bacon. I am not hungry anymore.
Verbose: I was outpaced culinarily by a sumptuous meal earlier this day, consisting of eggs and bacon. As such, I am admittedly beset by satiation.

Normal: who here likes drinking water?
Verbose: Who among us finds aqua to be quite salient, outpacing most other drinks hydrationally?

Normal: Where is my Destiny option in all this? It's either him or demon mama you have been warned.
Verbose: Given the current set of circumstances, I find myself wondering where my "Destiny" option is. Make no mistake, if you force me to choose between him and "demon mama", I shall choose the former without hesitation.

Normal: I think death note is better than grey's anatomy
Verbose: The animated cartoon "death note" has outpaced grey's anatomy audiovisually.

Normal: When walking to the store, I bumped into one of my friends
Verbose: While ambulating to the local supermarket, I happened to encounter a salient colleague of mine. 

Normal: I like pooping
Verbose: There is a certain satisfaction that comes from evacuating one's bowels, especially when said bowels are full of waste.

Normal: I disagree. There's a good reason to be annoyed by how dumb this is. 
Verbose: What a spite driven and contrarian point. I see legitimate cause to take umbrage with the dearth of salience.

Normal: I'm getting sleepy
Verbose: I am admittedly beset by tiredness

Normal: You have to admit that, as the owner of tesla, Elon may not want a developed high speed train competition.
Verbose: One must concede that, as the proprietor of Tesla, Elon Musk may not have a desire to see a developed high-speed train system which could potentially outpace his own company's products financially.

Normal: This man can unironically only enjoy pure sugar drinks and pizza, interesting how his approach to food and politics is so different... unless
Verbose: It is curious how this man's gustatory preferences for carbonated beverages and pizza negatively correlate with his political beliefs... unless of course

Normal: lol. Feel bad for her honestly. Clearly got a lot not going right for her mentally to be doing all this.
Verbose: I must admit, I experienced the emotional response of empathy upon reading this. It is quite evident that this individual is not in a stable frame of mind, given the actions she has taken.

Normal: How so? Itâ€™s been a while but from what I remember Oliver has always been pretty based.
Verbose: I am curious as to how you arrived at this conclusion. It has been some time, but if my memory serves me correctly, Oliver has always been rather "based" (a term which here means "salient").

Normal: My sister took the dog for a walk around the neighborhood
Verbose: My immediate relative, who resides chronologically beneath me in the order of birth, took the family canine for a constitutional about the periphery of the residential area in which we are domiciled.
